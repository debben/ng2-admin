# Debben changes to ng2-admin
This fork of ng2-admin contains changes which allow ng2-admin to be consumed as a package rather than be used as a boilerplate ng2 application. I've started several ng2 projects in which I want to use some, but not all of the components in ng2-admin. There have been some instances where I've found myself copying the component source, but this makes pulling in changes from the ng2-admin upstream a pain. What I'd really like is to be able to specify ng2-admin as a dependency, and import the components I want "a la cart". Unfortunately the components seem to be very tightly coupled and need some modification to be used independently. I'm currently using this repo to document what changes need to be made to achieve this (via issues) and store my work thus far.
